This tool takes the [Visual Studio Code icons](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html) and converts them into an icon font using [fantasticon](https://github.com/tancredi/fantasticon).

## Install
You can use the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/codicons) and install into your project via:

```
npm i @vscode/codicons
```

_Note: We've deprecated `vscode-codicons` in favor of `@vscode/codicons`_

If you're building a VS Code extension, see this [webview extension sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/webview-codicons-sample) on how to integrate.

# Building Locally

All icons are stored under `src > icons`. The mappings of the class names and unicode characters are stored in `src/template/mapping.json` as well as the default styles under `src/template/styles.hbs`.

## Install dependencies
After cloning this repo, install dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```

Output will be exported to a `dist` folder. We track this folder so that we can see the updated changes to the unicode characters.

## Update packages

You can run `npm outdated` to see if there are any package updates. To update packages, run:

```
npm update
```

## Add icons

Export your icons (svg) to the `src/icons` folder and add an entry into `src/template/mapping.json` with a new codepoint key (this gets converted into a unicode key) and run the the build command. The build command will also remove any subfolders in the `icons` folder to keep the folder structure consistent.

Next, update the [codicons file](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/base/common/codicons.ts) on the vscode repository, ensuring that the unicode characters are the same (you can reference the [css file](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons/blob/master/dist/codicon.css)).


## Using CSS Classes

If you're building a VS Code extension, see this [webview extension sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/webview-codicons-sample) on how to integrate.

When needing to reference an icon in the [Visual Studio Code source code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) via CSS classes, simply create a dom element/container that contains `codicon` and the [icon name](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html) like:

```html
<div class='codicon codicon-add'></div>
```

It's recommended to use a single dom element for each icon and not to add children elements to it.

## Using SVG Sprites

When needing to use the `codicon.svg` sprite file, you can reference icons using the following method:

```html
<svg>
    <use xlink:href="codicon.svg#add" />
</svg>
```
